# Overview of Project

1. Given a spreadsheet containing stock data, use VBA code to summarize data, then visualize trends using graphs.

2. Solve the problem for a single stock, then generalize to a list of 12 stocks, making 12 separate loops through the full data table.
3. Finally, optimize (refactor) the VBA code to run more efficiently by using a single loop and storing data in arrays with a row for each ticker.

4. Demonstrate the the code ran in less time after the modifications.

Include a screen capture that shows the code is commented clearly.

5. Extra Credit - in Module 1, I wrote a subroutine "Sub BuildTickerColumn(year$)" which returns the list of ticker values for a specific year based on the data in the spreadsheet rather than hard coding the values.





# Results of the Analysis (including screen shots and code snippets)

# Summary
## Explain the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code
## Explain the pros/cons of the original VBA script vs the refactored script
