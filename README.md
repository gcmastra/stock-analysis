# Overview of Project

1. Given a spreadsheet containing stock market ticker data for 12 stocks, use VBA code to summarize the data using conditional formatting.
2. Solve the problem for a single stock, then generalize to a list of 12 stocks, making 12 separate loops through the full data table.
3. Finally, optimize (refactor) the VBA code to run more efficiently by using a single loop and storing data in arrays with a row for each stock ticker.
4. Demonstrate the the code ran in less time after the refactoring.

# Technical Challenges
1. Include a screen capture that shows the code is commented clearly.
2. Create buttons in Excel that run subroutines to calculate the results using (a) nested loops (b) single refactored loop using data arrays

# Extra Credit?
in Module 1 of the VBA code (before the refactroing exercise), I wrote a subroutine "Sub BuildTickerColumn(year$)" which returns the list of ticker values for a specific year based on the data in the spreadsheet rather than hard coding the values.

# Summary
## Explain the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code
## Explain the pros/cons of the original VBA script vs the refactored script
